    <h1>Privacy Policy for Quirk Squad</h1>

    <p>At Quirk Squad, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you share with us.
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your data while you use our game.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect only the following information from our users:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Email address</strong> – Used to access your game data.</li>
        <li><strong>Username</strong> – Chosen by you during the registration process.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your email address is used solely to allow you to access your game data stored in our database. We do not use it
        for any other purpose, such as sending notifications or marketing materials.</p>

    <h2>3. How We Store Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your email and username are stored locally on your device in an SQLite database. This data remains on your device
        and is not transmitted or stored on our servers.</p>

    <h2>4. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>We do not share, sell, or transfer your email address or any other personal data to third parties. Your personal
        data is only used to manage your game experience.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>Your email and username are stored indefinitely on your device until you decide to cancel your account. If you
        choose to delete your account, all personal information will be removed from the database.</p>

    <h2>6. Data Protection</h2>
    <p>Currently, we do not implement any encryption or access control mechanisms for the data stored on your device.
        However, we are committed to continually improving our data protection practices.</p>

    <h2>7. User Rights</h2>
    <p>You have the right to request the deletion of your account and all associated personal data. To do so, you can
        delete your account directly within the game, and all personal information will be removed from the local
        database.</p>

    <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our game is intended for users who are 13 years or older. We do not knowingly collect personal data from
        children under the age of 13. If we learn that we have collected personal data from a child under 13, we will
        delete that information as soon as possible.</p>

    <h2>9. Legal Compliance</h2>
    <p>We aim to comply with applicable data protection laws, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
        for users in the European Union. If you are located outside of the EU, please be aware that we do not transfer
        data across borders.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and we encourage
        you to review it periodically to stay informed about how we protect your information.</p>
